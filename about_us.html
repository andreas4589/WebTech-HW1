        <h2>The story of Pieter-Jan</h2>
        <p>I am a 3rd year CS student at UU, I also recently moved to the city which is of course lovely. 
            I like playing basketball and tennis. Occasionally I also lift weights and play the guitar.
            I chose this course as web development is an interesting subject as much of our contemporary information
            structures rely on communication over the web.
