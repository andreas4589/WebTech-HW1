        <h2 class="title">The story of Andreas</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Andreas and I am currently finishing my bachelor AI of four years at Utrecht University. 
            Additionally, I am doing a minor in Computer Science to improve and expand my programming skills.
            I chose this course because I am interested in web development and I believe that it is a very useful skill to have.
            I am also interested in learning more about the history of web development and how it has evolved over the years.
            I moved to Utrecht about two years ago and I really enjoy living here.
            In my free time I like to workout, play video games and watch movies.

        <p>
            I am a 3rd year CS student at UU, I also recently moved to the city which is of course lovely. 
            I like playing basketball and tennis. Occasionally I also lift weights and play the guitar.
            I chose this course as web development is an interesting subject as much of our contemporary information
            structures rely on communication over the web. Why dont you go back to <a href="index.html">home</a>
