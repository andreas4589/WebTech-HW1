        <h2>The story of Taha</h2>
    
        <p >
            My name is Taha and I'm a 3rd year bachelor in computer science.
            I'm also an international student from France.
            I decided to study a semester in Utrecht University to discover another culture and
            education system, and for the moment, Ireally enjoy it !
            <br>
            I choosed this course because I find web technology a very interesting subject.
            I also think it will be useful for my future career since I want to work in this field.

        <h2>The story of Pieter-Jan</h2>
        <p>I am a 3rd year CS student at UU, I also recently moved to the city which is of course lovely. 
            I like playing basketball and tennis. Occasionally I also lift weights and play the guitar.
            I chose this course as web development is an interesting subject as much of our contemporary information
            structures rely on communication over the web. Why dont you go back to <a href="index.html">home</a>
