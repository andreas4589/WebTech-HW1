            <li>Set a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 200°F (93°C). If using very fresh, moist bread, arrange slices in a single layer on the rack and cook in oven, turning once, until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes.

            <li>Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla until thoroughly combined. Add milk and whisk to blend.Overhead view of egg and milk mixture in a light blue bowl.</li>
        
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium heat, swirling skillet, until foaming subsides, about 5 minutes. Soak 2 slices of bread in egg bath, turning, until saturated. Add soaked bread to skillet and cook, swirling occasionally, until browned on bottom side, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle top side of bread with sugar, flip, and continue to cook, swirling occasionally, until browned on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer French toast to the rack in the oven in a single layer to keep warm and repeat with remaining slices of bread and egg bath.Slices of French toast cooking in a cast iron skillet, in the first photo they aren't cooked yet, in the second they are golden brown.</li>

        <h3 >Instructions</h3>
        <ul class ="instructions">
            <li>In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook penne according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Season both sides of chicken with salt, pepper and oregano and cook until golden and no longer pink in the middle, 8 minutes per side. Transfer chicken a cutting board and let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing into strips.</li>
            <li>Make sauce: Add the white wine to deglaze the pan. When the wine is simmering, use a wooden spoon to scrape all the golden chicken bits from the pan. (They have a lot of flavor that you'll want in your sauce!)</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes and garlic and cook until the tomatoes soften slightly, about 2 minutes. Add cream and bring mixture back to a simmer. Add mozzarella and Parmesan and stir until the cheese melts. Season sauce with salt and pepper. </li>
            <li> Turn off heat and add in the cooked penne, baby spinach, parsley and red pepper flakes (if using). Toss until the pasta is evenly coated in sauce and the spinach has wilted slightly. Serve immediately. </li>
